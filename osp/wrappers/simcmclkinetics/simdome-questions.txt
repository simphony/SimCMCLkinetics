QUESTION 1
----------
How is the final output data reported to the calling code (i.e. the user). I cannot see a way to notify the calling
code that the simulation has completed. No knowledge of outputs seems to be present in the ontology so I assume
that they aren't simply added to the CUDS structure, is there some function that needs to be called with them
as an argument?


QUESTION 2
----------
If the user selects stupid values for their input parameters, are we providing any method to return the details listed
in the SRM log file to them? Is there any way to let users know why their simulation failed?


QUESTION 3
----------
What timeout should be used when waiting for submitted jobs to finish?


QUESTION 4
----------
Currently, the JSON data is dynamically generated from the current CUDS data. The names of entries in the JSON string
are taken from the class name of the CUDS object (which is in turn defined by the ontology). What happens if this name
does not match the input required in the JSON? I do not really want to store a hard-coded map of CUDS class to JSON
name (as this'll be a nightmare to keep up to date).


QUESTION 5
----------
As this wrapper code has no knowledge of what needs to be present in an JSON inputs string, it can only generate
JSON based on what's present in the input CUDS data. What happens if there's more (or less) in the CUDS structure
than the JSON requires?
